# Longest-Chain-Responsive
<p>This file includes the code for a system that takes 4 inputs, namely number of rows(n), and 3 colours. The code then creates an n by n random matrix of blocks each of a colour randomly selected out of the 3 input colours. Then it Highlights the longest horizontal chain of the same colour.</p><br>
<p>Also, it contains 7 builds that all have the same programs at different steps:<ol>
	<li>Build 1.0: 
		An unresponsive single colour 10 by 10 centered grid.</li>
	<li>Build 2.0:
		Responsive 10 by 10 single-colour grid with warp bug.</li>
	<li>Build 3.0:
		Responsive 10 by 10 grid with all random coloured blocks and warp bug.</li>
	<li>Build 4.0:
		Responsive 10 by 10 grid with blocks of 3 random colours and warp bug.</li>
	<li>Build 5.0:
		Responsive grid with input size and colours and warp bug.</li>
	<li>Build 6.0:
		The Complete working program without the longest horizontal chain highlight feature.</li>
	<li>Build 7.0:
		The Complete Program with all the features specified above.</li>
		
</ol></p>

<p>Note: This Code requires a PHP server to be executed. I recommend downloading <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">XAMPP</a> or <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/">MAMP</a> servers.
