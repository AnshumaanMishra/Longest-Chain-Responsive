# Longest-Chain-Responsive
This file includes the code for a system that takes 4 inputs, namely number of rows(n), and 3 colours. The code then creates an n by n random matrix of blocks each of a colour randomly selected out of the 3 input colours. Then it Highlights the longest horizontal chain of the same colour.
Also, it contains 7 builds that all have the same programs at different steps:
	1: Build 1.0: 
		An unresponsive single colour 10 by 10 centered grid.
	2: Build 2.0:
		Responsive 10 by 10 single-colour grid with warp bug.
	3: Build 3.0:
		Responsive 10 by 10 grid with all random coloured blocks and warp bug.
	4: Build 4.0:
		Responsive 10 by 10 grid with blocks of 3 random colours and warp bug.
	5: Build 5.0:
		Responsive grid with input size and colours and warp bug.
	6: Build 6.0:
		The Complete working program without the longest horizontal chain highlight feature.
	7: Build 7.0:
